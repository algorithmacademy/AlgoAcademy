#### Vectors &mdash; Level 2

Here we implement the structure ourselves without any pre-existing boilerplate code already

#### Vectors &mdash; Level 3

First we implemented a naive Vector.  Then were asked to implement it without the help of the
 pre-existing built-in functions.  In all cases, we were to ignore any edge cases or error
 conditions. 

Now we need to think about the edge cases and error conditions.
