###### This Exercise


Open [recursion-L1.js](ES6/src/recursion-L1.js) and follow the prompts below to complete the exercise.  Use 
 the [testRunner1.html](ES6/testRunner1.html) file to run the tests and view your progress.


###### Objective

Complete the following exercises.  You may use the Helper Function technique.

1. Write a recursive function that prints the digits of an integer in reverse order.
2. Write a recursive function to convert an integer to a binary string.
3. Write a recursive function that formats any positive integer with commas
4. Write a recursive function to return a string with the number of "X"s indicated by n
5. Write a recursive function to print a left-aligned triangle with the number of lines indicated by n
6. Write a recursive function to print a left-aligned triangle upside down with the number of lines indicated by n
7. Write a recursive function to reverse an array in-place
8. Write a recursive function to determine if two arrays are equal
9. Write a recursive function that will return the position of the largest element in an array
10. Write a recursive function to determine if array is sorted (in increasing order)
11. Write a recursive function to fill a pre-allocated array with increasing numbers from 1 to n
12. Write a recursive function to determine if an array is palindrome
13. Write a recursive function to flatten an array


###### BONUS:

 * After solving these with the Helper Function technique, try again usin the Pure Recursion
    technique.
 * After that, try L0 again using Pure Recursion.
