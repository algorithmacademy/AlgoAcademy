# Arrays &mdash; Introduction


###### Overview

Arrays are efficient for random access.  They are also the most common data structure,
 being built into nearly every programming language.  The following exercises should
 serve as a glorious warm-up to the next few topics.  The mechanics that you explore
 will become actual solutions to many of the exercises through the rest of this 
 program.


###### Edge Cases

 * What to do when you have more elements than capacity
 * Out of bounds conditions.  Array bounds is the set of all valid elements.  Anything < 0 or >= length is out of bounds


###### NOTES

 * Do not use built-in array functions or helpers like map, reduce, etc.
 * Solve the problem using only direct loops and such
 

###### This Exercise

Open [arrays-L1.js](ES6/src/arrays-L1.js) and follow the prompts below to complete the exercise.  Use 
 the [testRunner1.html](ES6/tests/testRunner1.html) file to run the tests and view your progress.


###### Objective

Complete the following exercises:

 1. Fill any array with value, zero if none provided, return original array
 2. Return the sum of all values in any array
 3. Return the average value of any array
 4. Return the median of any array that has both an odd and even number of values
 5. Return the index the value specified, or null if not found
 6. Return index of nth last odd in any array, 1 being the fist, etc., null = not found
 7. Select the subrange of an array into a new array
 8. Select a range of values in any array, return the average of the values of the range
 9. Copy contents of one array to another.  Do not use any built-in functions.
 10. Swap two elements in an array.  Return the same array passed in.  Do not use any built-in functions.
 11. Copy smaller array into larger array


###### BONUS:

 * N/A


###### Critical Whiteboard Skills

 * Understand the question, solve only what's asked
 * If something isn't clear, ask clarifying questions
 * Do not add requirements or over think it.  These aren't trick questions
