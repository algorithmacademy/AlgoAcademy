# Arrays &mdash; Introduction


###### Overview

This warmup and introduction is meant to help acquaint you with loops and arrays.  It's not a quiz,
 but meant more as exposure to different ways to manipulate arrays and loops.  Some of these questions
 may look familiar: they are.  They are drawn from the same question bank as your admissions interview.
 That's our starting point.


###### NOTES

 * Do not use built-in array functions or helpers like map, reduce, etc (push/pop are okay)
 * Solve the problem using only direct loops and such
 

###### This Exercise

Open [arrays-L0.js](ES6/src/arrays-L0.js) and follow the prompts below to complete the exercise.  Use 
 the [testRunner0.html](ES6/tests/testRunner0.html) file to run the tests and view your progress.


###### Objective

Complete the following exercises:

 1. Generate a Range I
 2. Generate a Range II
 3. Generate a Range III
 4. Generate a Range IV
 5. Generate Multiples of 5
 6. Generate Multiples of 3 I
 7. Generate Multiples of 3 II
 8. Generate Multiples of 3 III
 9. Generate Multiples of Either 3 or 5
 10. Surprise Me!
 11. Combine Two Arrays
 12. Does Array Contain Value?
 13. Temperature I
 14. Temperature II
 15. At Odds!


###### Primary Learning Goals

 * Warm up with different kinds of loops (for, while, do)
 * Warm up with different directions to iterate (forward, backwards) and count iterations (count by 1, -1, other than 1)
 * Warm up to reading and understand the prompt
 * Warm up to writing and calling functions (with or without parameters)
 * Warm up to understanding how the rest of this workshop runs tests


###### BONUS:

 1. Multiples of 3 And 5
 2. Generate Multiples of Range V
 3. Generate Multiples of Range VI
 4. Count Multiples of Range
 5. Combine Two Arrays, Interleaved I
 6. Combine Two Arrays, Interleaved II
 

###### Critical Whiteboard Skills

 * Understand the question, solve only what's asked
 * If something isn't clear, ask clarifying questions
 * Do not add requirements or over think it.  These aren't trick questions
