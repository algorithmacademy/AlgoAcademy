# Trees &mdash; Introduction


###### Overview

Until now, we've focused on sequential and associative structures.  Not all data is modeled sequentially.  Trees
 provide a way to organize data via hierarchy with parent-child relationships.  Data like our family tree, organization
 charts, or even the file system on your computer are excellent examples of hierarchical data structures.
