# Welcome to Algorithm Academy

It started before the summer of 2016.  A couple friends were experiencing difficulty interviewing and
one was soon to interview for a senior dev role at Uber, and another as a developer at facebook and 
were trying to figure out why.

I started http://algoacad.me as a way to personally mentor people one-on-one through the interview
process and http://bootcamped.com to mentor groups.  The process is the same, and the material is
the same.  The Data Structures portion contained in this repo is how I walk people through problem
solving and detect their weaknesses and help overcome them.  It's not designed for the primary 
purpose of learning (alghough it has that characteristic), it is designed so I can figure out what
parts of the technical interview need to be fixed.  As such it might be more thorough than you are
used to.

I will continue to mentor people and use the material here.  I initially wanted it to be open source
but wanted to test it first.

This was designed to be paired with mentoring, not necessary as a self-learning machanism.  

When I mentor people, I typically follow a schedule that looks resembles the following (for Part 1):

---

    Day 5:
        * Review
        * Graphs II
```

The progression assumes that comfort with arrays will lead to comfort with Dynamic
Arrays because of similar coding dynamics, and the comfort with dynamic arrays and Linked
Lists will lead to comfort with HashTables because either can be used as the storage
mechanism, and so on.  

My audience was mostly Javascript programmers but I also mentored programmers with a Java,
Python, and C# background and everything worked fine.  The only difference is the automated
tests and reference code use Javascript.

I open source this because my mentoring is not about algorithms, anyway.  As someone who has 
overseen 200 person developer teams, CEO'd and CTO'd, I have a knack for what we're looking 
for when hiring.  When I mentor its more of a troubleshooting exercise to figure out where in 
the process from writing the resume, to salary negotiation, the problem is and fix it.  Everyone 
grinded LeetCode but some still had struggles there or with systems design.  This is the component
that focused on algorithms.

I hope you find this to be helpful during your preparation for interviews.
