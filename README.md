# Welcome to Algorithm Academy

Since July 2016 I have been helping people (via http://algoacad.me) to learn the fundamentals of 
data structures during their job search.  I tend to do mostly one-on-one mentoring as
opposed to classes.  For classes, I ran the http://bootcamped.com program . Many of those I work with have
been practicing LeetCode or similar, had read the book "Cracking the Coding
Interview" and various Udemy courses.  And still feel they struggle during interviews.

After running mock interviews with them it appeared the fundamental issue
was their comfort working the basic data structures (Linked Lists, Arrays, Stacks,
Trees, Graphs, etc).  During interviews they would spend a lot of time recalling
and working out how to traverse a LinkedList rather than spending time reversing
it, and so on.  Many of the algorithm/toy-problem style questions assume one is
familiar with the data structures, to begin with.

So I created a series of exercises that start with the basics of manipulating arrays
working up to Graphs and Sorting.  Each topic built on the previous, but more importantly
used techniques and descriptions from previous topics to make it easier to learn and
correlate what needs to be done.

I have decided to open source the _classwork_ portion of the program in these files
initially, and will work to open source the homework and mentoring part of it,
also in upcoming weeks.

As I'm curating files from the private Bitbucket repo some parts might be missing.  Let
me know if so and I'll track down the originals or re-create them.

The Algorithm Academy program is broken into two parts:

1) **Foundations of Data Structures**.  This covers topics like arrays, bit manipulation,
 recursion, graphs, searching, sorting, etc.
   
2) **Algorithm Techniques**.  This covers algorithm techniques like brute force,
 dynamic programming, backtracking, divide and conquer, etc.
   

At first I'll provide Part 1 and once I've cleaned up the Part 2 material I'll publish
it also.

When I mentor people, I typically follow a schedule that looks like the following (for Part 1):

Along with the course material I also use various related interview style questions
that directly relate the the topic at hand.  In upcoming weeks I'll add the selection
to this repo that I used during the program along with my solutions.  There are a lot
details tested for in here, and the premise was that when someone is able to answer 
them then during an interview they will not spend too much time trying to remember 
how things work, and can instead focus on the question being asked.

<br />
<br />

This material was designed to be guided with a mentor, not to be self-guided so
there might be some rough parts.  I'll smooth them out.

It progressed in parts, starting with Level 0 (sometimes) that was pre-work for
the topic.  Then Level 1 that was an intro, to Level 2 and 3 if applicable.  The 
original intention was the by level 4 one would be a ninja but in practice, it just
ended up being easier then harder questions.  Perhaps I'll revisit the progression
in the future.  As such, every topic has an L0 but it might be blank for some.  For
those, an pre-work was not written or deemed necessary.

<br />
<br />

I hope you find this to be helpful during your preparation for interviews.

One last thing, the source code here is in javascript tho I had Java and Python programmers
in my mentorship, everything worked fine.  I just had to provide the expected results, rather
than run automated tests to test for it.  As this is an open source repo, contributions
are welcome and I will provide some of the Python answers that my apprentices have provided.

<br />

I wanted the material to be open source from the beginning but used my mentoring sessions from
algoacad.me and classes from Bootcamped to calibrate the quality.  My mentoring is not about 
algorithms, anyway.  As someone who has overseen 200 person developer teams, CEO'd and CTO'd, 
I have a knack for what we're looking for when hiring.  When I mentor its more of a troubleshooting
exercise to figure out where in the process from writing the resume, to salary negotiation, the
problem is and fix it.  Everyong grinded LeetCode but some still had struggles there or with
systems design.  This is the component that focused on algorithms.

I will continue to mentor people as I feel moved to.
